# Python-Todo-List
A todo list I coded in my Python Class for my final project

To run: 
`python todo3.py`

System Requirements: 
* A functional computer
* Python version 3.5.0 or above (may work with older versions, untested) 
* Write access to the directory

Suggested: 
It may be wise to rename todo3.py to todo.py. They're named in order of version, and as major changes/landmarks were made. 
The database files correspond to the version of the file. (hardcoded, not filename-based)
